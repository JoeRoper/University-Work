Sosig Studios: Anteater Highway First Playable ReadMe


Game Design Overview:
Our client has asked us to make a game that will help raise awareness about the troubles anteaters currently face in Brazil as a result of land development, specifically on the issues they face when crossing roads. Our team has made Anteater Highway, a game focused on preventing cars from hitting anteaters as they travel through a series of roadways looking for food.
